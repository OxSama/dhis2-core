**Capture app container**

The Capture web app is the main core app for entering individual level data. It contains the tools for clinical use of individual level data. Definitons of the data that can be collected and viewed, as well as authorization rules, is governed entirely by the relevant metadata defined in the _metadata api container_ by the _maintenance web app container_. 
The Capture web app functionality is broken into two main use cases seamlessly served through the same user interface; individual events programs and tracked entity related events programs. 

In the individual events programs, the data is collected in the context of the program(along with any attribute options), organisation unit and a date. Each event contains data for one or more data elements, as defined in the metadata definition.
In the tracked entity related events programs, data is collected in the context of the program, a tracked entity(for example a person), an organisation unit and a date. The data collected here is hierarchical; an event contains data for one or more data elements, and many events are grouped into an enrollment. This enrollment belongs to one tracked entity.
